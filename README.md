# JavaNote
Here is the notes when I learned java. 

I had not written notes seriously when I learned java for the first time in high school. 
So I nearly lost my ability to write java after using Python for a long time at university.

Recently I need to learned Hadoop and wrote MapReduce in java, so I took notes again.
Wish I could keep my java programming skills forever :)
